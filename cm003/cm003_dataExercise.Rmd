## R Markdown
Here is an equation:

$$\alpha = 5 + 2$$

Inline equation: $\alpha = 5 + 2$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:echo=FALSE so the chunk dosen't plot

```{r cars,echo=FALSE,fig.width=3,fig.height=4}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
